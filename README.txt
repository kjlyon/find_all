-- To compile the code sample, type `make`.

-- To use it:
   `./find_all tree-root pattern`

-- To generate a random tree directory structure with random file names, use the
script `./create_test_tree.sh tree-root tree-depth files-per-level` where:

   `tree-root`: the name of the root directory for the structure that will be created
   `tree-depth`: The depth of the tree
   `files-per-level`: number of files that will be created per level
